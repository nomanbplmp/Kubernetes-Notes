What is Kubernetes Engine?
Kubernetes Engine is GCP's hosted version of Kubernetes - a powerful cluster manager and orchestration system for containers. Kubernetes is an open source project that can run on many different environments—from laptops to high-availability multi-node clusters; from virtual machines to bare metal. As mentioned before, Kubernetes apps are built on Containers - these are lightweight applications bundled with all the necessary dependencies and libraries to run them. This underlying structure makes Kubernetes applications highly available, secure, and quick to deploy—an ideal framework for cloud developers.

What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that lets you flexibly orchestrate your build, test, and deployment pipelines. Jenkins allows developers to iterate quickly on projects without worrying about overhead issues that can stem from continuous delivery.

What is Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment?
When you need to set up a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline, deploying Jenkins on Kubernetes Engine provides important benefits over a standard VM-based deployment.

When your build process uses containers, one virtual host can run jobs on multiple operating systems. Kubernetes Engine provides ephemeral build executors — these are only utilized when builds are actively running, which leaves resources for other cluster tasks such as batch processing jobs. Another benefit of ephemeral build executors is speed — they launch in a matter of seconds.

Kubernetes Engine also comes pre-equipped with Google's global load balancer, which you can use to automate web traffic routing to your instance(s). The load balancer handles SSL termination and utilizes a global IP address that's configured with Google's backbone network—coupled with your web front, this load balancer will always set your users on the fastest possible path to an application instance.
